# Personalized-Film-Recommender
In this project I web scrapped data from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes to build a model that predicts the score the individual user would provide for a movie given their past preferences.

In the file imdb.py, I web scrapped the movies from imdb. In the file Film Rating Project.ipynb, I web scrapped the movies from rotten tomatoes. And finally in the Final Rating Project Part 2, I use the data to generate my prediction model.
